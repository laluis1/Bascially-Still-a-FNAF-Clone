# Basically Still a FNAF Clone
My friend told me in 8th grade that I should not talk badly about FNAF because I could never make anything like it. Apart from the terrible graphics, the mechanics are the same, it was a dare made in a day.
THIS IS NOT A FNAF CLONE IN THE GENERAL SENSE

<b>Edit: Despite me saying that this isn't a fnaf clone many years ago, it pretty much is :/</b>
<i>Also, the code isn't the same as I put into jar, forgot to save, like an idiot, and had to reverse engineer so, looks funnny, srry :((</i>
