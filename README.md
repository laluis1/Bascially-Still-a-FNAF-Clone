My friend told me in 8th grade that I should not talk badly about FNAF because I could never make anything like it. Apart from the terrible graphics, the mechanics are the same, it was a dare made in a day.
THIS IS NOT A FNAF CLONE IN THE GENERAL SENSE

#Edit: Despite me saying that this isn't a fnaf clone many years ago, it pretty much is :/
